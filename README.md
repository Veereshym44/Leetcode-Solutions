# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This collection of LeetCode questions is designed to help you ace your coding interviews and enhance your problem-solving skills.

## About LeetCode

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) is a popular platform for practicing coding problems and preparing for technical interviews. It offers a wide range of algorithmic and data structure challenges that can be both fun and challenging to solve.

## Repository Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to provide solutions and explanations for a variety of LeetCode problems. Whether you're a beginner looking to improve your coding skills or an experienced coder preparing for technical interviews at top tech companies, you'll find valuable resources here.

## How to Use This Repository

### Problem Solutions

Inside this repository, you'll find a directory structure organized by problem difficulty (easy, medium, and hard). Each subdirectory contains the solutions and explanations for specific LeetCode problems.

- **Easy**: Problems labeled as "Easy" are suitable for beginners and cover fundamental data structures and algorithms.

- **Medium**: "Medium" problems are moderately challenging and often require a deeper understanding of algorithms and problem-solving strategies.

- **Hard**: The "Hard" category includes the most challenging problems that will test your algorithmic skills to the fullest.

### Getting Started

If you're new to LeetCode or programming interviews, consider starting with some easy problems to build a strong foundation. As you progress, move on to medium and hard problems to challenge yourself.
